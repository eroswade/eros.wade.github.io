测试了WEBKIT for win 和 CDHTMLDLG. 

都存在很大的缺陷  HTMLDLG 不支持HTML5 对CSS支持很差. WEBKIT应该来说是最好的,但在WIN上存在很大的问题. 在UNIX下编程会比较OK. 

另一种方式: 用PYTHON 做,但不知道PYTHON对WEBKIT支持怎么样. 支持GTK OK.而且兼容OPENCV. 调试也方便.



== install opencv ==


    Below Python packages are to be downloaded and installed to their default locations.

        1.1. Python-2.7.x.

        1.2. Numpy.

        1.3. Matplotlib (Matplotlib is optional, but recommended since we use it a lot in our tutorials).

    Install all packages into their default locations. Python will be installed to C:/Python27/.

    After installation, open Python IDLE. Enter import numpy and make sure Numpy is working fine.

    Download latest OpenCV release from sourceforge site and double-click to extract it.

    Goto opencv/build/python/2.7 folder.

    Copy cv2.pyd to C:/Python27/lib/site-packeges.

    Open Python IDLE and type following codes in Python terminal.

    >>> import cv2
    >>> print cv2.__version__

If the results are printed out without any errors, congratulations !!! You have installed OpenCV-Python successfully.

== install pygtk ==
just install it by msi pack

== install cefpython ==
there is no webkit pack on windows system. so i choice cefpython instead.
run setup.py install

== opencv debug ==
opencv can run line by line. 

== GTK CEF test ==
a little difficult.
